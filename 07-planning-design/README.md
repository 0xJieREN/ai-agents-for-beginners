# Name Of Lesson

## Introduction

This lesson will cover

* Defining a clear overall goal and breaking a complex task into manageable tasks.
* Leveraging structured output for more reliable and machine-readable responses.
* Applying an event-driven approach to handle dynamic tasks and unexpected inputs.

## Learning Goals

After completing this lesson, you will have an understanding about:

* Identify and set an overall goal for an AI agent, ensuring it clearly knows what needs to be achieved.
* Decompose a complex task into manageable subtasks and organize them into a logical sequence.
* Equip agents with the right tools (e.g., search tools or data analytics tools), decide when and how they are used, and handle unexpected situations that arise.
* Evaluate subtask outcomes, measure performance, and iterate on actions to improve the final output.

## Defining the Overall Goal and Breaking Down a Task

Most real-world tasks are too complex to tackle in a single step. An AI agent needs a concise objective to guide its planning and actions. For example, consider the goal:

    "Generate a 3-day travel itinerary."

While it is simple to state, it still needs refinement. The clearer the goal, the better the agent (and any human collaborators) can focus on achieving the right outcome, such as creating a comprehensive itinerary with flight options, hotel recommendations, and activity suggestions.

### Task Decomposition

 Large or intricate tasks become more manageable when split into smaller, goal-oriented subtasks.
For the travel itinerary example, you could decompose the goal into:

* Flight Booking
* Hotel Booking
* Car Rental
* Personalization

Each subtask can then be tackled by dedicated agents or processes. One agent might specialize in searching for the best flight deals, another focuses on hotel bookings, and so on. A coordinating or “downstream” agent can then compile these results into one cohesive itinerary to the end user.

This modular approach also allows for incremental enhancements. For instance, you could add specialized agents for Food Recommendations or Local Activity Suggestions and refining the itinerary over time.

e.g sample code

    ```python

    ```

### Iterative Planning

Some tasks require a back-and-forth or re-planning , where the outcome of one subtask influences the next. For example, if the agent discovers an unexpected data format while booking flights, it might need to adapt its strategy before moving on to hotel bookings.

Additionally, user feedback (e.g. a human deciding they prefer an earlier flight) can trigger a partial re-plan. This dynamic, iterative approach ensures that the final solution aligns with real-world constraints and evolving user preferences

e.g sample code

    ```python

    ```

### Structured output

Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate structured output (e.g. JSON) that is easier for downstream agents or services to parse and process. This is especially useful in a multi-agent context, where we can action these tasks after the planning output is received.

e.g sample code

    ```python

    ```

## Additional Resources

Using o1 reasoning models have proved quite adavnaced in planning complex tasks - TODO: Share example?

Autogen Magentic One - A Generalist multi agent system for solving complex task and has achieved impressive results on multiple challenging agentic benchmarks. Reference: [autogen-magentic-one](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one). In this implementation the orcestrator create task specific plan and delegates these tasks to the available agents. In addition to planning the orchestrator also employs a tracking mechanism to monitor the progress of the task and re-plans as required.
