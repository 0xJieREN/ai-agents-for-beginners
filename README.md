## üå± Getting Started

This course has 10 lessons covering the fundamentals of building AI Agents. Each lesson covers its own topic so start wherever you like!

If this is your first time building with Generative AI models. Check out our ![Generative AI For Beginners](https://aka.ms/genai-beginners) course that has 22 lessons on building with GenAI.

### To run the code of this course

This course has code examples that use these service for Models:

- [Github Models](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/github-models)
- [Azure AI Foundry](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/ai-foundry)

This coures also uses these AI Agent frameworks and services:

- [Azure AI Agent Service](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/ai-agent-service)
- [Semantic Kernel](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/semantic-kernel)
- [AutoGen](https://aka.ms/ai-agents/autogen)

For more information on running the code for this course, go to the [Course Setup](./00-course-setup/README.md).
