## 1. Introduction to Metacognition
Metacognition refers to the higher-order cognitive processes that involve thinking about oneâ€™s own thinking. For AI agents, this means being able to evaluate and adjust their actions based on self-awareness and past experiences.

## What is Metacognition?
Metacognition, or "thinking about thinking," is a higher-order cognitive process that involves self-awareness and self-regulation of one's cognitive processes. In the realm of AI, metacognition empowers agents to evaluate and adapt their strategies and actions, leading to improved problem-solving and decision-making capabilities. By understanding metacognition, you can design AI agents that are not only more intelligent but also more adaptable and efficient.

### Importance of Metacognition in AI Agents
Metacognition plays a crucial role in AI agent design for several reasons:

- Self-Reflection: Agents can assess their own performance and identify areas for improvement.
- Adaptability: Agents can modify their strategies based on past experiences and changing environments.
- Error Correction: Agents can detect and correct errors autonomously, leading to more accurate outcomes.
- Resource Management: Agents can optimize the use of resources, such as time and computational power, by planning and evaluating their actions.

### Components of an AI Agent
Before diving into metacognitive processes, it's essential to understand the basic components of an AI agent. An AI agent typically consists of:

- Persona: The personality and characteristics of the agent, which define how it interacts with users.
- Tools: The capabilities and functions that the agent can perform.
- Skills: The knowledge and expertise that the agent possesses.

These components work together to create an "expertise unit" that can perform specific tasks.

**Example**: 
Consider a travel agent, agent services that not only plans the your holiday but also adjusts its path based on real-time data and past customer journey experiences.

### Example: Metacognition in a Travel Agent Service

Imagine you're designing a travel agent service powered by AI. This agent, "Travel Agent," assists users with planning their vacations. To incorporate metacognition, Travel Agents needs to evaluate and adjust its actions based on self-awareness and past experiences. Here's how metacognition could play a role:

#### Current Task
The current task is to help a user plan a trip to Paris.

#### Steps to Complete the Task
1. **Gather User Preferences**: Ask the user about their travel dates, budget, interests (e.g., museums, cuisine, shopping), and any specific requirements.
2. **Retrieve Information**: Search for flight options, accommodations, attractions, and restaurants that match the user's preferences.
3. **Generate Recommendations**: Provide a personalized itinerary with flight details, hotel reservations, and suggested activities.
4. **Adjust Based on Feedback**: Ask the user for feedback on the recommendations and make necessary adjustments.

#### Required Resources
- Access to flight and hotel booking databases.
- Information on Parisian attractions and restaurants.
- User feedback data from previous interactions.

#### Experience and Self-Reflection
Travel Agent uses metacognition to evaluate its performance and learn from past experiences. For example:

1. **Analyzing User Feedback**: Travel Agent reviews user feedback to determine which recommendations were well-received and which were not. It adjusts its future suggestions accordingly.
2. **Adaptability**: If a user has previously mentioned a dislike for crowded places, Travel Agent will avoid recommending popular tourist spots during peak hours in the future.
3. **Error Correction**: If Travel Agent made an error in a past booking, such as suggesting a hotel that was fully booked, it learns to check availability more rigorously before making recommendations.

#### Practical Developer Example
Here's a simplified example of how Travel Agents code might look when incorporating metacognition:

```python
class Travel_Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_preferences = {}
        self.experience_data = []

    def gather_preferences(self, preferences):
        self.user_preferences = preferences

    def retrieve_information(self):
        # Search for flights, hotels, and attractions based on preferences
        flights = search_flights(self.user_preferences)
        hotels = search_hotels(self.user_preferences)
        attractions = search_attractions(self.user_preferences)
        return flights, hotels, attractions

    def generate_recommendations(self):
        flights, hotels, attractions = self.retrieve_information()
        itinerary = create_itinerary(flights, hotels, attractions)
        return itinerary

    def adjust_based_on_feedback(self, feedback):
        self.experience_data.append(feedback)
        # Analyze feedback and adjust future recommendations
        self.user_preferences = adjust_preferences(self.user_preferences, feedback)

# Example usage
travel_agent = Travel_Agent()
preferences = {
    "destination": "Paris",
    "dates": "2025-04-01 to 2025-04-10",
    "budget": "moderate",
    "interests": ["museums", "cuisine"]
}
travel_agent.gather_preferences(preferences)
itinerary = travel_agent.generate_recommendations()
print("Suggested Itinerary:", itinerary)
feedback = {"liked": ["Louvre Museum"], "disliked": ["Eiffel Tower (too crowded)"]}
travel_agent.adjust_based_on_feedback(feedback)
```

#### Why Metacognition Matters
- **Self-Reflection**: Agents can analyze their performance and identify areas for improvement.
- **Adaptability**: Agents can modify strategies based on feedback and changing conditions.
- **Error Correction**: Agents can autonomously detect and correct mistakes.
- **Resource Management**: Agents can optimize resource usage, such as time and computational power.

By incorporating metacognition, Travel Agent can provide more personalized and accurate travel recommendations, enhancing the overall user experience.

        self.user_preferences = preferences

    def retrieve_information(self):
        flights = search_flights(self.user_preferences)
        hotels = search_hotels(self.user_preferences)
        attractions = search_attractions(self.user_preferences)
        return flights, hotels, attractions

    def generate_recommendations(self):
        flights, hotels, attractions = self.retrieve_information()
        itinerary = create_itinerary(flights, hotels, attractions)
        return itinerary

    def adjust_based_on_feedback(self, feedback):
        self.experience_data.append(feedback)
        self.user_preferences = adjust_preferences(self.user_preferences, feedback)

# Example usage within a booing request
travel_agent = Travel_Agent()
preferences = {
    "destination": "Paris",
    "dates": "2025-04-01 to 2025-04-10",
    "budget": "moderate",
    "interests": ["museums", "cuisine"]
}
travel_agent.gather_preferences(preferences)
itinerary = travel_agent.generate_recommendations()
print("Suggested Itinerary:", itinerary)
feedback = {"liked": ["Louvre Museum"], "disliked": ["Eiffel Tower (too crowded)"]}
travel_agent.adjust_based_on_feedback(feedback)
```

## 3. Corrective RAG System

#### Introduction to RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to enhance the performance of AI agents. In a RAG system, the agent retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and uses it to generate appropriate responses or actions.

#### Corrective RAG Approach
The Corrective RAG approach focuses on using RAG techniques to correct errors and improve the accuracy of AI agents. This involves:

1. **Prompting Technique**: Using specific prompts to guide the agent in retrieving relevant information.
2. **Tool**: Implementing algorithms and mechanisms that enable the agent to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved information and generate accurate responses.
3. **Evaluation**: Continuously assessing the agent's performance and making adjustments to improve its accuracy and efficiency.

#### Example: Corrective RAG in a Search Agent
Consider a search agent that retrieves information from the web to answer user queries. The Corrective RAG approach might involve:

1. **Prompting Technique**: Formulating search queries based on the user's input.
2. **Tool**: Using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to rank and filter search results.
3. **Evaluation**: Analyzing user feedback to identify and correct inaccuracies in the retrieved information.

### Corrective RAG in Travel Agent

Corrective RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances an AI's ability to retrieve and generate information while correcting any inaccuracies. Let's see how Travel Agent can use the Corrective RAG approach to provide more accurate and relevant travel recommendations.

### Corrective RAG Approach

The Corrective RAG approach focuses on using RAG techniques to correct errors and improve the accuracy of AI agents. This involves:

- Prompting Technique: Using specific prompts to guide the agent in retrieving relevant information.
- Tool: Implementing algorithms and mechanisms that enable the agent to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved information and generate accurate responses.
- Evaluation: Continuously assessing the agent's performance and making adjustments to improve its accuracy and efficiency.

#### Steps for Implementing Corrective RAG in Travel Agent:

1. **Initial User Interaction**
   - Travel Agent gathers initial preferences from the user, such as destination, travel dates, budget, and interests.
   - Example:
     ```python
     preferences = {
         "destination": "Paris",
         "dates": "2025-04-01 to 2025-04-10",
         "budget": "moderate",
         "interests": ["museums", "cuisine"]
     }
     ```

2. **Retrieval of Information**
   - Travel Agent retrieves information about flights, accommodations, attractions, and restaurants based on user preferences.
   - Example:
     ```python
     flights = search_flights(preferences)
     hotels = search_hotels(preferences)
     attractions = search_attractions(preferences)
     ```

3. **Generating Initial Recommendations**
   - Travel Agent uses the retrieved information to generate a personalized itinerary.
   - Example:
     ```python
     itinerary = create_itinerary(flights, hotels, attractions)
     print("Suggested Itinerary:", itinerary)
     ```

4. **Collecting User Feedback**
   - Travel Agent asks the user for feedback on the initial recommendations.
   - Example:
     ```python
     feedback = {
         "liked": ["Louvre Museum"],
         "disliked": ["Eiffel Tower (too crowded)"]
     }
     ```

5. **Corrective RAG Process**
   - **Prompting Technique**: Travel Agent formulates new search queries based on user feedback.
     - Example:
       ```python
       if "disliked" in feedback:
           preferences["avoid"] = feedback["disliked"]
       ```
   - **Tool**: Travel Agent uses algorithms to rank and filter new search results, emphasizing the relevance based on user feedback.
     - Example:
       ```python
       new_attractions = search_attractions(preferences)
       new_itinerary = create_itinerary(flights, hotels, new_attractions)
       print("Updated Itinerary:", new_itinerary)
       ```
   - **Evaluation**: Travel Agent continuously assesses the relevance and accuracy of its recommendations by analyzing user feedback and making necessary adjustments.
     - Example:
       ```python
       def adjust_preferences(preferences, feedback):
           if "liked" in feedback:
               preferences["favorites"] = feedback["liked"]
           if "disliked" in feedback:
               preferences["avoid"] = feedback["disliked"]
           return preferences

       preferences = adjust_preferences(preferences, feedback)
       ```

#### Practical Example:
Here's a simplified Python code example incorporating the Corrective RAG approach in Travel Agent:

```python
class Travel_Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_preferences = {}
        self.experience_data = []

    def gather_preferences(self, preferences):
        self.user_preferences = preferences

    def retrieve_information(self):
        flights = search_flights(self.user_preferences)
        hotels = search_hotels(self.user_preferences)
        attractions = search_attractions(self.user_preferences)
        return flights, hotels, attractions

    def generate_recommendations(self):
        flights, hotels, attractions = self.retrieve_information()
        itinerary = create_itinerary(flights, hotels, attractions)
        return itinerary

    def adjust_based_on_feedback(self, feedback):
        self.experience_data.append(feedback)
        self.user_preferences = adjust_preferences(self.user_preferences, feedback)
        new_itinerary = self.generate_recommendations()
        return new_itinerary

# Example usage
travel_agent = Travel_Agent()
preferences = {
    "destination": "Paris",
    "dates": "2025-04-01 to 2025-04-10",
    "budget": "moderate",
    "interests": ["museums", "cuisine"]
}
travel_agent.gather_preferences(preferences)
itinerary = travel_agent.generate_recommendations()
print("Suggested Itinerary:", itinerary)
feedback = {"liked": ["Louvre Museum"], "disliked": ["Eiffel Tower (too crowded)"]}
new_itinerary = travel_agent.adjust_based_on_feedback(feedback)
print("Updated Itinerary:", new_itinerary)
```

### RAG: Prompting Technique vs Tool

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be both a prompting technique and a tool in the development of AI agents. Understanding the distinction between the two can help you leverage RAG more effectively in your projects.

#### RAG as a Prompting Technique

**What is it?**
- As a prompting technique, RAG involves formulating specific queries or prompts to guide the retrieval of relevant information from a large corpus or database. This information is then used to generate responses or actions.

**How it works:**
1. **Formulate Prompts**: Create well-structured prompts or queries based on the task at hand or the user's input.
2. **Retrieve Information**: Use the prompts to search for relevant data from a pre-existing knowledge base or dataset.
3. **Generate Response**: Combine the retrieved information with generative AI models to produce a comprehensive and coherent response.

**Example in Travel Agent**:
- User Input: "I want to visit museums in Paris."
- Prompt: "Find top museums in Paris."
- Retrieved Information: Details about Louvre Museum, MusÃ©e d'Orsay, etc.
- Generated Response: "Here are some top museums in Paris: Louvre Museum, MusÃ©e d'Orsay, and Centre Pompidou."

#### RAG as a Tool

**What is it?**
- As a tool, RAG is an integrated system that automates the retrieval and generation process, making it easier for developers to implement complex AI functionalities without manually crafting prompts for each query.

**How it works:**
1. **Integration**: Embed RAG within the AI agent's architecture, allowing it to automatically handle the retrieval and generation tasks.
2. **Automation**: The tool manages the entire process, from receiving user input to generating the final response, without requiring explicit prompts for each step.
3. **Efficiency**: Enhances the agent's performance by streamlining the retrieval and generation process, enabling quicker and more accurate responses.

**Example in Travel Agent**:
- User Input: "I want to visit museums in Paris."
- RAG Tool: Automatically retrieves information about museums and generates a response.
- Generated Response: "Here are some top museums in Paris: Louvre Museum, MusÃ©e d'Orsay, and Centre Pompidou."

def search_museums_in_paris():
    prompt = "Find top museums in Paris"
    search_results = search_web(prompt)
    return search_results

museums = search_museums_in_paris()
print("Top Museums in Paris:", museums)
```

**Tool Example:**
```python
class Travel_Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rag_tool = RAGTool()

    def get_museums_in_paris(self):
        user_input = "I want to visit museums in Paris."
        response = self.rag_tool.retrieve_and_generate(user_input)
        return response

travel_agent = Travel_Agent()
museums = travel_agent.get_museums_in_paris()
print("Top Museums in Paris:", museums)
```
### Evaluating Relevancy

Evaluating relevancy is a crucial aspect of AI agent performance. It ensures that the information retrieved and generated by the agent is appropriate, accurate, and useful to the user. Let's explore how to evaluate relevancy in AI agents, including practical examples and techniques.

#### Key Concepts in Evaluating Relevancy

1. **Context Awareness**:
   - The agent must understand the context of the user's query to retrieve and generate relevant information.
   - Example: If a user asks for "best restaurants in Paris," the agent should consider the user's preferences, such as cuisine type and budget.

2. **Accuracy**:
   - The information provided by the agent should be factually correct and up-to-date.
   - Example: Recommending currently open restaurants with good reviews rather than outdated or closed options.

3. **User Intent**:
   - The agent should infer the user's intent behind the query to provide the most relevant information.
   - Example: If a user asks for "budget-friendly hotels," the agent should prioritize affordable options.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Continuously collecting and analyzing user feedback helps the agent refine its relevancy evaluation process.
   - Example: Incorporating user ratings and feedback on previous recommendations to improve future responses.

#### Practical Techniques for Evaluating Relevancy

1. **Relevance Scoring**:
   - Assign a relevance score to each retrieved item based on how well it matches the user's query and preferences.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def relevance_score(item, query):
         score = 0
         if item['category'] in query['interests']:
             score += 1
         if item['price'] <= query['budget']:
             score += 1
         if item['location'] == query['destination']:
             score += 1
         return score
     ```

2. **Filtering and Ranking**:
   - Filter out irrelevant items and rank the remaining ones based on their relevance scores.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def filter_and_rank(items, query):
         ranked_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: relevance_score(item, query), reverse=True)
         return ranked_items[:10]  # Return top 10 relevant items
     ```

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Use NLP techniques to understand the user's query and retrieve relevant information.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def process_query(query):
         # Use NLP to extract key information from the user's query
         processed_query = nlp(query)
         return processed_query
     ```

4. **User Feedback Integration**:
   - Collect user feedback on the provided recommendations and use it to adjust future relevance evaluations.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def adjust_based_on_feedback(feedback, items):
         for item in items:
             if item['name'] in feedback['liked']:
                 item['relevance'] += 1
             if item['name'] in feedback['disliked']:
                 item['relevance'] -= 1
         return items
     ```

#### Example: Evaluating Relevancy in Travel Agent

Here's a practical example of how Travel Agent can evaluate the relevancy of travel recommendations:

```python
class Travel_Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_preferences = {}
        self.experience_data = []

    def gather_preferences(self, preferences):
        self.user_preferences = preferences

    def retrieve_information(self):
        flights = search_flights(self.user_preferences)
        hotels = search_hotels(self.user_preferences)
        attractions = search_attractions(self.user_preferences)
        return flights, hotels, attractions

    def generate_recommendations(self):
        flights, hotels, attractions = self.retrieve_information()
        ranked_hotels = self.filter_and_rank(hotels, self.user_preferences)
        itinerary = create_itinerary(flights, ranked_hotels, attractions)
        return itinerary

    def filter_and_rank(self, items, query):
        ranked_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: self.relevance_score(item, query), reverse=True)
        return ranked_items[:10]  # Return top 10 relevant items

    def relevance_score(self, item, query):
        score = 0
        if item['category'] in query['interests']:
            score += 1
        if item['price'] <= query['budget']:
            score += 1
        if item['location'] == query['destination']:
            score += 1
        return score

    def adjust_based_on_feedback(self, feedback, items):
        for item in items:
            if item['name'] in feedback['liked']:
                item['relevance'] += 1
            if item['name'] in feedback['disliked']:
                item['relevance'] -= 1
        return items

# Example usage
travel_agent = Travel_Agent()
preferences = {
    "destination": "Paris",
    "dates": "2025-04-01 to 2025-04-10",
    "budget": "moderate",
    "interests": ["museums", "cuisine"]
}
travel_agent.gather_preferences(preferences)
itinerary = travel_agent.generate_recommendations()
print("Suggested Itinerary:", itinerary)
feedback = {"liked": ["Louvre Museum"], "disliked": ["Eiffel Tower (too crowded)"]}
updated_items = travel_agent.adjust_based_on_feedback(feedback, itinerary['hotels'])
print("Updated Itinerary with Feedback:", updated_items)
```

### Search with Intent

Searching with intent involves understanding and interpreting the underlying purpose or goal behind a user's query to retrieve and generate the most relevant and useful information. This approach goes beyond simply matching keywords and focuses on grasping the user's actual needs and context.

#### Key Concepts in Searching with Intent

1. **Understanding User Intent**:
   - User intent can be categorized into three main types: informational, navigational, and transactional.
     - **Informational Intent**: The user seeks information about a topic (e.g., "What are the best museums in Paris?").
     - **Navigational Intent**: The user wants to navigate to a specific website or page (e.g., "Louvre Museum official website").
     - **Transactional Intent**: The user aims to perform a transaction, such as booking a flight or making a purchase (e.g., "Book a flight to Paris").

2. **Context Awareness**:
   - Analyzing the context of the user's query helps in accurately identifying their intent. This includes considering previous interactions, user preferences, and the specific details of the current query.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - NLP techniques are employed to understand and interpret the natural language queries provided by users. This includes tasks like entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and query parsing.

4. **Personalization**:
   - Personalizing the search results based on the user's history, preferences, and feedback enhances the relevancy of the information retrieved.

#### Practical Example: Searching with Intent in Travel Agent

Let's take Travel Agent as an example to see how searching with intent can be implemented.

1. **Gathering User Preferences**
   ```python
   class Travel_Agent:
       def __init__(self):
           self.user_preferences = {}

       def gather_preferences(self, preferences):
           self.user_preferences = preferences
   ```

2. **Understanding User Intent**
   ```python
   def identify_intent(query):
       if "book" in query or "purchase" in query:
           return "transactional"
       elif "website" in query or "official" in query:
           return "navigational"
       else:
           return "informational"
   ```

3. **Context Awareness**
   ```python
   def analyze_context(query, user_history):
       # Combine current query with user history to understand context
       context = {
           "current_query": query,
           "user_history": user_history
       }
       return context
   ```

4. **Search and Personalize Results**
   ```python
   def search_with_intent(query, preferences, user_history):
       intent = identify_intent(query)
       context = analyze_context(query, user_history)
       if intent == "informational":
           search_results = search_information(query, preferences)
       elif intent == "navigational":
           search_results = search_navigation(query)
       elif intent == "transactional":
           search_results = search_transaction(query, preferences)
       personalized_results = personalize_results(search_results, user_history)
       return personalized_results

   def search_information(query, preferences):
       # Example search logic for informational intent
       results = search_web(f"best {preferences['interests']} in {preferences['destination']}")
       return results

   def search_navigation(query):
       # Example search logic for navigational intent
       results = search_web(query)
       return results

   def search_transaction(query, preferences):
       # Example search logic for transactional intent
       results = search_web(f"book {query} to {preferences['destination']}")
       return results

   def personalize_results(results, user_history):
       # Example personalization logic
       personalized = [result for result in results if result not in user_history]
       return personalized[:10]  # Return top 10 personalized results
   ```

5. **Example Usage**
   ```python
   travel_agent = Travel_Agent()
   preferences = {
       "destination": "Paris",
       "interests": ["museums", "cuisine"]
   }
   travel_agent.gather_preferences(preferences)
   user_history = ["Louvre Museum website", "Book flight to Paris"]
   query = "best museums in Paris"
   results = search_with_intent(query, preferences, user_history)
   print("Search Results:", results)
   ```

### Example: Code Generating Agent for Travel Agent

In this example, we'll design a code generating agent, Travel Agent, to assist users in planning their travel by generating and executing code. This agent can handle tasks such as fetching travel options, filtering results, and compiling an itinerary using generative AI.

#### Overview of the Code Generating Agent

1. **Gathering User Preferences**: Collects user input such as destination, travel dates, budget, and interests.
2. **Generating Code to Fetch Data**: Generates code snippets to retrieve data about flights, hotels, and attractions.
3. **Executing Generated Code**: Runs the generated code to fetch real-time information.
4. **Generating Itinerary**: Compiles the fetched data into a personalized travel plan.
5. **Adjusting Based on Feedback**: Receives user feedback and regenerates code if necessary to refine the results.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Gathering User Preferences**
   ```python
   class Travel_Agent:
       def __init__(self):
           self.user_preferences = {}

       def gather_preferences(self, preferences):
           self.user_preferences = preferences
   ```

2. **Generating Code to Fetch Data**
   ```python
   def generate_code_to_fetch_data(preferences):
       # Example: Generate code to search for flights based on user preferences
       code = f"""
       def search_flights():
           import requests
           response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/flights', params={preferences})
           return response.json()
       """
       return code

   def generate_code_to_fetch_hotels(preferences):
       # Example: Generate code to search for hotels
       code = f"""
       def search_hotels():
           import requests
           response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/hotels', params={preferences})
           return response.json()
       """
       return code
   ```

3. **Executing Generated Code**
   ```python
   def execute_code(code):
       # Execute the generated code using exec
       exec(code)
       result = locals()
       return result

   travel_agent = Travel_Agent()
   preferences = {
       "destination": "Paris",
       "dates": "2025-04-01 to 2025-04-10",
       "budget": "moderate",
       "interests": ["museums", "cuisine"]
   }
   travel_agent.gather_preferences(preferences)
   
   flight_code = generate_code_to_fetch_data(preferences)
   hotel_code = generate_code_to_fetch_hotels(preferences)
   
   flights = execute_code(flight_code)
   hotels = execute_code(hotel_code)

   print("Flight Options:", flights)
   print("Hotel Options:", hotels)
   ```

4. **Generating Itinerary**
   ```python
   def generate_itinerary(flights, hotels, attractions):
       itinerary = {
           "flights": flights,
           "hotels": hotels,
           "attractions": attractions
       }
       return itinerary

   attractions = search_attractions(preferences)
   itinerary = generate_itinerary(flights, hotels, attractions)
   print("Suggested Itinerary:", itinerary)
   ```

5. **Adjusting Based on Feedback**
   ```python
   def adjust_based_on_feedback(feedback, preferences):
       # Adjust preferences based on user feedback
       if "liked" in feedback:
           preferences["favorites"] = feedback["liked"]
       if "disliked" in feedback:
           preferences["avoid"] = feedback["disliked"]
       return preferences

   feedback = {"liked": ["Louvre Museum"], "disliked": ["Eiffel Tower (too crowded)"]}
   updated_preferences = adjust_based_on_feedback(feedback, preferences)
   
   # Regenerate and execute code with updated preferences
   updated_flight_code = generate_code_to_fetch_data(updated_preferences)
   updated_hotel_code = generate_code_to_fetch_hotels(updated_preferences)
   
   updated_flights = execute_code(updated_flight_code)
   updated_hotels = execute_code(updated_hotel_code)
   
   updated_itinerary = generate_itinerary(updated_flights, updated_hotels, attractions)
   print("Updated Itinerary:", updated_itinerary)
   ```

### Using SQL as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Technique

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for interacting with databases. When used as part of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, SQL can retrieve relevant data from databases to inform and generate responses or actions in AI agents. Let's explore how SQL can be used as a RAG technique in the context of Travel Agent.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Database Interaction**:
   - SQL is used to query databases, retrieve relevant information, and manipulate data.
   - Example: Fetching flight details, hotel information, and attractions from a travel database.

2. **Integration with RAG**:
   - SQL queries are generated based on user input and preferences.
   - The retrieved data is then used to generate personalized recommendations or actions.

3. **Dynamic Query Generation**:
   - The AI agent generates dynamic SQL queries based on the context and user needs.
   - Example: Customizing SQL queries to filter results based on budget, dates, and interests.

#### Practical Example: Using SQL in Travel Agent

1. **Gathering User Preferences**
   ```python
   class Travel_Agent:
       def __init__(self):
           self.user_preferences = {}

       def gather_preferences(self, preferences):
           self.user_preferences = preferences
   ```

2. **Generating SQL Queries**
   ```python
   def generate_sql_query(table, preferences):
       query = f"SELECT * FROM {table} WHERE "
       conditions = []
       for key, value in preferences.items():
           conditions.append(f"{key}='{value}'")
       query += " AND ".join(conditions)
       return query
   ```

3. **Executing SQL Queries**
   ```python
   import sqlite3

   def execute_sql_query(query, database="travel.db"):
       connection = sqlite3.connect(database)
       cursor = connection.cursor()
       cursor.execute(query)
       results = cursor.fetchall()
       connection.close()
       return results
   ```

4. **Generating Recommendations**
   ```python
   def generate_recommendations(preferences):
       flight_query = generate_sql_query("flights", preferences)
       hotel_query = generate_sql_query("hotels", preferences)
       attraction_query = generate_sql_query("attractions", preferences)
       
       flights = execute_sql_query(flight_query)
       hotels = execute_sql_query(hotel_query)
       attractions = execute_sql_query(attraction_query)
       
       itinerary = {
           "flights": flights,
           "hotels": hotels,
           "attractions": attractions
       }
       return itinerary

   travel_agent = Travel_Agent()
   preferences = {
       "destination": "Paris",
       "dates": "2025-04-01 to 2025-04-10",
       "budget": "moderate",
       "interests": ["museums", "cuisine"]
   }
   travel_agent.gather_preferences(preferences)
   itinerary = generate_recommendations(preferences)
   print("Suggested Itinerary:", itinerary)
   ```

#### Example SQL Queries
1. **Flight Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM flights WHERE destination='Paris' AND dates='2025-04-01 to 2025-04-10' AND budget='moderate';
   ```

2. **Hotel Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE destination='Paris' AND budget='moderate';
   ```

3. **Attraction Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM attractions WHERE destination='Paris' AND interests='museums, cuisine';
   ```


By leveraging SQL as part of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, AI agents like Travel Agent can dynamically retrieve and utilize relevant data to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.
